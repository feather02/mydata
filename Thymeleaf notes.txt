Loop a List by Index in Thymeleaf:
- In Thymeleaf, we use th:each attribute for iteration. Thymeleaf th:each allows you to declare an iteration status variable.
- In the below example, we are using ${employeeStat.index} expression to get an index of the list:
	<tr th:each="employee : ${employees}">
	 <td th:text="${employeeStat.index}"></td>
	 <td th:text="${employee.firstName}"></td>
	 <td th:text="${employee.lastName}"></td>
	 <td th:text="${employee.email}"></td>
	</tr>
- The employeeStat is the aggregation of the variable employee with the suffix Stat.

The th:case = "*" is the default case of the th:switch/th:case structure.
